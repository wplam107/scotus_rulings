## Motivation
From early to mid-2020 US Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the "liberal" wing of the US Supreme Court.  He is a George W. Bush appointment which prompted many to think he would be a "conservative" justice.  There are several different methodologies in terms of determining whether a justice is conservative vs. liberal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_leanings_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_justices).  However, there are times when those 2 labels might not tell everything.  Certain justices have considered themselves textualists (Thomas, Gorsuch), originalists (Alito), or none (Roberts).  As a lay person, it can be hard to understand what those labels truly mean in the legal/judicial world.
